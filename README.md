Tolkien, with philological purposes, and then gave use to this languages in his broad collection of Middle-earth books. Later in time, this languages have been adapted to modern day-use. There were two main languages in the begining, '*Quenya*' and '*Sindarin*'. Quenya is also known as the language of the '*High-elven*', and was strongly influenced by Finish. On the other hand, there's '*Sindarin*', the language of the '*Grey-elven*', which was influenced by Welsh.
