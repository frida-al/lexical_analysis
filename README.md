# Context & Description
The language chosen for this evidence is "*Elven (or Elvish)*". This set of languages was created by the talented writter, J. R. R. Tolkien, with philological purposes, and then gave use to this languages in his broad collection of Middle-earth books. Later in time, this languages have been adapted to modern day-use. There were two main languages in the begining, '*Quenya*' and '*Sindarin*'. Quenya is also known as the language of the '*High-elven*', and was strongly influenced by Finish. On the other hand, there's '*Sindarin*', the language of the '*Grey-elven*', which was influenced by Welsh.

In this evidence, only a few words belonging to the Elvish languages will be used, and the words are the following:
- Ando: Quenya word for 'Gate'.
- Andúril: Quenya word for 'Flame-of-the-West', which is the name of the sword of Aragorn, formerly know as 'Narsil'.
- Andúnë: Quenya word for 'sunset, west'.
- Anga: Quenya word for 'Iron'.
- Ann-thannath - Combination of Sindarin words meaning 'The-Gift-of-Words'. A mode of verse and song, among the Elves of Beleriand.

### Automata
---
"A finite automaton is an abstract machine used to recognize patterns in input sequences, forming the basis for understanding regular languages in computer science" (Geeks for Geeks, 2024).
Automata are composed of states, transitions and symbols. 
To formally define Automata, we use the following symbols:
{K, Σ, q0, F, δ}, where:
- K is the number of states in the automaton
- Σ is the finite alphabet
- q0 is the initial state 
- F is the final state
- δ represents the transitions in the automaton
